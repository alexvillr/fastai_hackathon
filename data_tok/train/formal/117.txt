xxbos xxmaj southwood and xxmaj kivelson ( 2001 ) suggested that a magnetospheric compression would cause an increase in the degree of magnetospheric plasma corotation ( i.e. the quantity ( ωj - ωm ) would decrease ) , and this would consequently lead to a sizeable decrease in xxup m - i coupling currents and auroral emission .
