xxbos xxmaj in the present study , a realistic xxup meg forward model using the boundary element method ( bem ) is used to calculate g ( huang et al . , 2007 ; xxmaj mosher et al . , 1 xxrep 3 9 ) , and in xxup bem the θ and ϕ-orientations are obtained as the two dominant orientations from the singular - value decomposition ( svd ) of the xxup m×3 lead - field matrix for each dipole , as previously documented ( huang et al . , 2006 ) .
