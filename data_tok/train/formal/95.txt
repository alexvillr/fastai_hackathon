xxbos xxmaj two scenarios with identical geometry were tested by varying the threshold pressure of the shales within xxmaj utsira xxmaj formation : the first , a base case , assumed that the threshold pressure of approximately 1.6 - 1.9mpa measured in core recovered from xxmaj lower xxmaj seal shales ( springer and xxmaj lindgren , 2006 ) is applicable to all shale barriers within the model .
