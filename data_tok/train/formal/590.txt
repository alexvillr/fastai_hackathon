xxbos xxmaj in this xxmaj figure the modelling results are shown as lines considering the contribution to the fracture energy , xxmaj gc , due to ( i ) plastic shear - band yielding in the epoxy matrix polymer only and ( ii ) plastic shear - band yielding and plastic void growth in the epoxy matrix polymer but arising from only 14.3 % of those nanoparticles present being active in terms of initiating this latter debonding and the plastic void growth toughening mechanism .
