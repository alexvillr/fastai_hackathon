xxbos xxmaj the finite wing theory equations are applied in a similar way as done by xxmaj paraschivoiu for the stream - tube model [ 16 ] , e.g.(11)a0=1.8π(0.8tbc),(12)cl = cl∞1+a0πar,(13)αe = α - clπarand(14)cd = cd∞+cl2πarare used as follows : xxmaj the reduced angle of attack is calculated using xxmaj eqs .
