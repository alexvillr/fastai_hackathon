xxbos xxmaj in xxmaj section 4 we showed that the dominant direction of perturbations of the boundary normal , including those normals for crossings clearly associated with waves , is related to the direction of the local magnetospheric field vector , and we highlighted that this magnetic field influence is consistent with xxup k - h instability theory ( e.g. xxmaj southwood , 1968 ) .
