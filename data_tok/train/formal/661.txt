xxbos xxmaj these ratios are of great importance in a variety of application areas , including statistics [ e.g. , 7 ] and numerical analysis [ e.g. , 1 ] , either directly or through the fact that by the well - known recurrence relations for modified xxmaj bessel functions , log(iν)′(t)=iν′(t)iν(t)=iν+1(t)+(ν / t)iν(t)iν(t)=rν(t)+νt from which by integration and taking limits , log(iν)(t)=∫0trν(s)ds+νlog(t / 2)-log(γ(ν+1 ) ) .
