xxbos xxmaj this empirical curve follows the features of the farm - aggregated xxmaj siemens xxup swt-2.3 - 82 power curve ( solid line ) , albeit shifted to the right ( as xxup nasa speeds are the theoretical maximum , and actual speeds will be lower due to local site features ) and downwards ( due to downtime and sub - optimal turbine calibration ) , with substantial scatter ( as local conditions like turbulence vary over time ) .
