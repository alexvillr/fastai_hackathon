xxbos xxmaj this is further supported by the band around 752 - 746cm-1 in the metal complexes due to ν(cs ) and is inconsistent with the appearance of new weakly to medium bands in the region 356 - 382cm-1 , which could be assigned to the stretching frequencies of ν(ms ) bands , respectively , confirmed that , the chelation to the metal ions is achieved thiol - sulphur atoms [ 41 ] .
