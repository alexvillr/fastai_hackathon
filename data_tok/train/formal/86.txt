xxbos xxmaj the interplay of forces ( viscous , capillary and gravity ) in reservoir models is commonly defined using scaling - group theory ( ringrose et al . , 1993 ; xxmaj li and xxmaj lake , 1995 ) , with the commonly accepted limiting condition for invasion percolation being that the capillary force must exceed the viscous force by a ratio of ten thousand - to - one .
