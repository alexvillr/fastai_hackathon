xxbos a stepwise approach to xxup dcm was used ( stephan et al . , 2010 ) , which included 1 ) specifying the network by systematic variation of intrinsic anatomical connections and the connections that are modulated by experimental context ; 2 ) fitting the data to the model by optimising model parameters ; 3 ) estimating the free energy limit on model evidences and 4 ) identifying the most likely model using a hierarchical xxmaj bayesian model comparison .
