xxbos xxmaj paleobathymetry estimates in the xxmaj north xxmaj sea during the xxmaj paleocene and xxmaj eocene are difficult to constrain accurately , as the extant benthic foraminifera present in the xxmaj paleogene are found today living between 200 and > 1 xxrep 3 0 m water depth ( gradstein et al . , 1992 ) , and are controlled predominantly by substrate and bottom water properties .
