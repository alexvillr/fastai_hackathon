xxbos xxmaj for all three clay mineral ratios there is a poorly defined negative relationship between weathering intensity from the geochemistry and the weathering intensity in the clay mineralogy , although some of this relationship may be caused by the effects of grain size , this could also be attributed to the loss of potassium and the increase in both kaolinite and smectite during chemical weathering .
