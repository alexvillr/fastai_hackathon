xxbos xxmaj the xxup ins spectrum for the bare xxup nott-300 , collected at âˆ¼5k to minimise the thermal motion of the adsorbed xxup h2 and the framework host , was found to be similar to those for mofs containing polyphenyl rings [ 18,21 - 23 ] , and this experimental spectrum is in good agreement with the xxup ins spectrum obtained from xxup dft calculation ( fig . 3(a ) ) [ 24 ] .
