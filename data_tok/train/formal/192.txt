xxbos xxmaj finally , a saturation isothermal remanent magnetization ( sirm ) was induced in the samples with a xxmaj redcliffe 700 xxup bsm pulse magnetiser set to 1 t and the remanence measured using a xxmaj molspin xxmaj minispin magnetometer , which was inter - calibrated with the xxup squid magnetometer .
