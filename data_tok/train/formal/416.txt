xxbos xxmaj modelling was undertaken for 4 major elements ( c , xxmaj ca , xxup o , and xxup h ) and up to 9 minor elements ( ba , xxmaj cd , xxmaj cr , xxup k , xxmaj mg , xxmaj ni , xxmaj sr , xxmaj ti , and xxmaj zn ) based on those which are considered to be most volatile , have the greatest negative impact on the environment and health , and which were present in the highest quantities in the limestone as identified by xxup icp - ms analysis as outlined in xxmaj table 2 , in order to investigate partitioning behaviour under pilot scale xxup co2 capture conditions .
