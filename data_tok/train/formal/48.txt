xxbos xxmaj instead , we use idealized transit depths based on a uniformly emitting stellar disk in xxmaj section 3 to show that the optical depth of the extended thermosphere in the xxup fuv lines is significant and that the transit in the o xxup i , c xxup ii , and xxmaj si xxrep 3 i lines is comparable to the transit in the h i line .
