xxbos xxmaj due to its isolated position ( mutti et al . , 1 xxrep 3 9 ; xxmaj brandano et al . , 2012 ) and long - term stratigraphic record of shallow water sediments ( vecsei and xxmaj sanders , 1997 ) this carbonate platform is well suited to identify local processes possibly overprinting regional or global signals in neritic carbonates .
