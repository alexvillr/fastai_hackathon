xxbos xxmaj the buoyant separate phase behavior of xxup co2 in the formation not only promotes gravity segregation , but also results in strong capillary forces at the interface between the ascending gas ( non - wetting fluid ) and the brine ( wetting fluid ) in the pore throats of the geological media , which manifest as threshold pressures for the sandstones and shales .
