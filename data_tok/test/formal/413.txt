xxbos xxmaj if the reason for the lower wind speed of one turbine is that it is in the wake of another , decreasing the rotational velocity of the upstream turbine will decrease its power absorption ( if it was running at optimal rotational velocity before ) , but will at the same time leave more energy for the turbine downstream .
