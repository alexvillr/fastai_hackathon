xxbos xxmaj assuming that ( 1 ) sponge spicule silicon isotopes reflect both the silicic acid concentration and isotopic composition , and ( 2 ) the intermediate waters bathing xxmaj site 689 and the surface waters near xxmaj site 1090 have a common source , in defining δδ30si we are approximating a measure of the ocean 's silicic acid gradient between xxmaj sites 689 and 1090 .
