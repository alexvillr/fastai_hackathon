xxbos ( 6 ) ) xxmaj in this context , a single velocity estimate consists of many pulses averaged over several seconds to produce an estimate of the error in the xxmaj doppler velocity ( barlow et al . , 2011a , after xxmaj pearson et al . , 2009):(6)σe=(δv22αnp(1 + 1.6α+0.4α2))0.5where xxmaj np is the accumulated photon count:(7)np = snr⋅m⋅nand α is the ratio of the lidar detector photon count to the speckle count:(8)α = snr(2π)0.5(δv / xxmaj b)δv is the signal spectral width , xxup snr is the signal to noise ratio , m is the number of points per range gate , n is the number of pulses averaged , and b is the bandwidth .
