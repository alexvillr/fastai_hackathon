xxbos xxmaj increased kaolinite at the xxup petm had been regarded as indicative of an increase in chemical weathering and hence humidity in the source region ( e.g. xxmaj robert and xxmaj kennett , 1994 ; xxmaj knox , 1996 ) , but the long formation time of thick soil kaolinite ( > 1myr ) suggests these increased proportions probably resulted from erosion of previously formed kaolinite ( thiry and xxmaj dupuis , 2 xxrep 3 0 ; xxmaj schmitz et al . , 2001 ) .
