xxbos xxmaj the xxmaj q - criterion was proposed by xxmaj hunt et al . ( 1988 ) as means by which vortices could be identified more easily and is defined as(1)q=12(|ω|2-|s|2),where a vortex is identified as a region where xxup q>0 , characterised when the vorticity tensor , ω is more prominent than the flow shear , represented by the strain - rate tensor , xxup s. xxmaj for the fixed - axis autorotating plate of xxmaj fig . 8 , vortex shedding is observed from the retreating and advancing edges , as well as the side edges during each rotation .
