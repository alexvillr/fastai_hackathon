xxbos xxmaj the simulations are carried out on three different computational grids : a xxmaj cartesian grid with δx=0.05 m and δy=0.075 m , a highly distorted grid obtained by deforming the above - mentioned xxmaj cartesian grid following the procedure proposed by xxmaj visbal and xxmaj gaitonde ( 2002 ) ( see xxmaj fig . 18 ) and a curvilinear boundary conforming grid ( see xxmaj fig . 19 ) .
