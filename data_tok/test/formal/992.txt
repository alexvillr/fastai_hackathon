xxbos ( 2 ) seems to indicate that the behaviour of the open circuit voltage is positive with temperature , but it is in fact dominated by the temperature dependence of the diode saturation current , which is given as(3)i0 = btγexp(egkt)where b is an empirical factor which is temperature independent and dominated by material quality , γ is an empirical factor depending on the specific loss mechanism that is dominating in the cell and xxup eg is the band gap of the cell .
