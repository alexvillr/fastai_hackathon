xxbos xxmaj this fact can be easily proved directly , but we will give an alternative point of view based on a representation of the ring int(mn(z ) ) as an intersection of pullbacks of xxup q[x ] , which turn out to be equal to a particular class of rings of integer - valued polynomials over algebraic integers .
