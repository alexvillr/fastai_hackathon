xxbos ( in the uprush the sequence is from right to left because the xxmaj reynolds number is initially highest and decreases thereafter as velocity and depth decrease ; in the backwash the sequence is left - right - left because xxmaj re first increases as flow accelerates , it reaches a maximum , and then decreases late in the backwash as the flow decelerates and becomes shallower . ) xxmaj there are two distinct periods when the friction factors behave differently from what would be expected for steady uniform flow .
