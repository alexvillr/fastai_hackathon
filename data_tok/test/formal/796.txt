xxbos xxmaj we observed that a pristine silicon wafer sample shows root mean square roughness xxup srms of 2.4±0.3 nm while a sputter coated wafer with gold - palladium reflective film shows xxup srms of 1.96±0.2 nm , and the peak - to - valley roughnesses are 16±2.30 nm and 13.6±1.6 nm respectively .
