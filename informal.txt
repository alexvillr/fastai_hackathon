HistoricalAd4089

He does exhibit a few skills not everyone has; he has poise and sass, and his way of walking catches the eye and keeps it riveted. He can wear pretty much anything, no matter how uncomfortable or strange, and not change his facial expression or his walk in excess. And he has intensity, in his walk and eyes. All of those are desirable qualities in catwalk models, drag queens and probably a few more professions.

Is it at a professional level? Not really (although these days there are some catwalk models that walk worse than he does), but with adequate training, he could be a star.

Yes, he is absolutely selling these unwearable items. That’s what a model does. He picked textures and shapes that read like clothing and he rocked the fuck out of it, it shows he can wear something avant-garde and make others interested, which can be the most difficult ensemble to pull of.

There’s a lot of types of modeling and while he may not end up on cat walks there’s certainly space for him in the field.

There are tons of other skills associated with being a model and he kills it in this video, I’m sure there’s technical skills he will need to learn but selling an item while acting like what you’re wearing is both a look and uncumbersome is a talent to it’s own.

Photos of women in bikinis take a lot more skill than people recognize. I’m not going to go too far into it but you have to know your body, your angles, your lighting, how to hold your eyes open into direct sun with salt water splashing into your eyes, off-season at many degrees colder or hotter than anyone would be comfortable in— is a skill. These are reasons candid photos are candid, models are presenting a fantasy and he rocks it out of the park.

In this video : He’s gutter-chic in the best sense and shows anyone can be if they want to.

Models are an interesting breed and their skill set is like any other, real passion can take you far.

Edit to add: there was a fashion show a few years back where the models wore another model strapped to their body, face of the second model was in their groin. It’s a funny and unexpected business

As a former model (back in the pre social media days) with professional training, and a sister who is a much more successful model, he fucking slays. This is top tier runway skills. Especially the sassy way he turns his head and the end of the runway. The way he crosses his legs when he walks and the overall pacing… also the constant facial expression. He’s brilliant. Also love his androgynous look for the runway. He has nice cheek bones, beautiful complexion and a really bold eye & brow area. he could totally pull off edgy, masculine, or soft/feminine looks

Honestly, no, not at present. His catwalk-walk is similar to (but not identical to) the way female models walk. Male models walk differently - less hip use, less putting one foot directly in front of the other, less hands on hip.

But, given his obvious talent for body language and imitation, I have no doubt he could learn the "correct" way to walk as a male fashion model. And then it's just a matter of whether or not he has the right look - and that is a fickle and unpredictable thing. Certainly, he's skinny enough, so who knows? Good luck to him say I!

He also has the height and he can walk androgynous or quirky lines no problem — Thom Browne, Gaultier, McQueen, Gucci, maybe even Loewe under Jonathan Anderson, and so many more would love him. This guy can MOVE and is completely unphased by whatever uncomfortable thing is on him — shantay, he can STAY, I say!

I'm kind of interested to see if, the way the world is evolving, one day there won't really be a "male" and "female" walk but they will just be used interchangeably depending on context?

There's one male model who already does kind of what you describe - he walks differently depending on the designer. For highly theatrical/melodramatic/androgynous fashion shows, he walks like female models do (and then some!) and for more conventional/traditional designers, he has the classic "male model" walk - minimal upper body movement, walks quickly in a straight line and a slightly aggressive stance.

He's fantastic to watch, and (rightly) receives a lot of attention and praise for his skill: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=By5Pcaw9Uw4
