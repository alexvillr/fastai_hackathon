One may as well generalize the above definition to also account for probabilistic stabilization by defining an appropriate probability space on the set of executions of M. For the sake of brevity and better readability, we only informally state the probability space in this work by introducing basic modules that act in a probabilistic manner, namely the Randomized Watchdog Timers.
