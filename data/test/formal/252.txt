This cellular defect is rescued by ectopic expression of PGRN in human PGRN S116X neurons, consistent with previous findings that PGRN promotes the survival of rodent primary neurons (Van Damme et al., 2008; Ryan et al., 2009; Xu et al., 2011) and activates the PI3K/Akt/S6K pathway in cancer cells (Zanocco-Marani et al., 1999).
