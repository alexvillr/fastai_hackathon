Increased kaolinite at the PETM had been regarded as indicative of an increase in chemical weathering and hence humidity in the source region (e.g. Robert and Kennett, 1994; Knox, 1996), but the long formation time of thick soil kaolinite (>1myr) suggests these increased proportions probably resulted from erosion of previously formed kaolinite (Thiry and Dupuis, 2000; Schmitz et al., 2001).
