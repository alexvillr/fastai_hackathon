The buoyant separate phase behavior of CO2 in the formation not only promotes gravity segregation, but also results in strong capillary forces at the interface between the ascending gas (non-wetting fluid) and the brine (wetting fluid) in the pore throats of the geological media, which manifest as threshold pressures for the sandstones and shales.
