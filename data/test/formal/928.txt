The Q-criterion was proposed by Hunt et al. (1988) as means by which vortices could be identified more easily and is defined as(1)Q=12(|Ω|2-|S|2),where a vortex is identified as a region where Q>0, characterised when the vorticity tensor, Ω is more prominent than the flow shear, represented by the strain-rate tensor, S. For the fixed-axis autorotating plate of Fig. 8, vortex shedding is observed from the retreating and advancing edges, as well as the side edges during each rotation.
