Possible explanations include the accumulated influence of isotopic discrimination during selective microbial decomposition of specific substrates within the SOM (Nadelhoffer and Fry, 1988; Buchmann et al., 1997; Lin et al., 1999), and more importantly by the increased contribution of microbially derived C to SOM with depth (Ehleringer et al., 2000; HÃ¶gberg et al., 2005).
