Simultaneous introduction of the genes for a glycolate catabolic pathway from E. coli, viz., GLYCOLATE DEHYDROGENASE (GDH), GLYOXYLATE CARBOLIGASE (GCL) and TARTRONIC SEMIALDEHYDE REDUCTASE (TSR), into A. thaliana using co-transformation and stacking, improved photosynthetic efficiency and increased biomass [93].
