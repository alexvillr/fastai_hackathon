The first visualization, the Monotone Slice-size Graph (MSG) (Binkley and Harman, 2005), plots a landscape of monotonically increasing slice sizes where the y-axis shows the size of each slice, as a percentage of the entire program, and the x-axis shows each slice, in monotonically increasing order of slice size.
