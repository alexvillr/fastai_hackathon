Such a reorganisation and restructuring of the polysaccharide phase with increasing CdS loading can potentially be explained by repulsive forces and changes in surface charge as the porous hybrid structure is formed, generating the observed higher total pore volumes and expansion of the corresponding pore size distributions (Fig. 4).
