(In the uprush the sequence is from right to left because the Reynolds number is initially highest and decreases thereafter as velocity and depth decrease; in the backwash the sequence is left-right-left because Re first increases as flow accelerates, it reaches a maximum, and then decreases late in the backwash as the flow decelerates and becomes shallower.) There are two distinct periods when the friction factors behave differently from what would be expected for steady uniform flow.
