Geochemical analysis of Arabian Sea sediment has attracted significant interest from those seeking to reconstruct changing chemical weathering and provenance during the Cenozoic, over various timescales through analysis of elemental ratios or isotopic systems (e.g., Papavassiliou and Cosgrove, 1982; Suczek and Ingersoll, 1985; Fagel et al., 1994; Sirocko et al., 2000; Staubwasser and Sirocko, 2001; Clift and Blusztajn, 2005; Colin et al., 2006; Limmer et al., 2012).
