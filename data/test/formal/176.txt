(6)) In this context, a single velocity estimate consists of many pulses averaged over several seconds to produce an estimate of the error in the Doppler velocity (Barlow et al., 2011a, after Pearson et al., 2009):(6)σe=(Δv22αNp(1+1.6α+0.4α2))0.5where Np is the accumulated photon count:(7)Np=SNR⋅M⋅nand α is the ratio of the lidar detector photon count to the speckle count:(8)α=SNR(2π)0.5(Δv/B)Δv is the signal spectral width, SNR is the signal to noise ratio, M is the number of points per range gate, n is the number of pulses averaged, and B is the bandwidth.
