Assuming that (1) sponge spicule silicon isotopes reflect both the silicic acid concentration and isotopic composition, and (2) the intermediate waters bathing Site 689 and the surface waters near Site 1090 have a common source, in defining Δδ30Si we are approximating a measure of the ocean's silicic acid gradient between Sites 689 and 1090.
