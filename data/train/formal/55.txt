The INS spectrum for the bare NOTT-300, collected at âˆ¼5K to minimise the thermal motion of the adsorbed H2 and the framework host, was found to be similar to those for MOFs containing polyphenyl rings [18,21-23], and this experimental spectrum is in good agreement with the INS spectrum obtained from DFT calculation (Fig. 3(a)) [24].
