Furthermore, the synchronicity of the unradiogenic Osi pattern suggests that the magnitude of Caribbean LIP volcanism was sufficient to simultaneously influence the seawater chemistry of each basin; the abundance of organic-rich sediments added to the water column as a result of enhanced continental weathering permitted sequestration of hydrogenous unradiogenic Os from the contemporaneous Caribbean LIP.
