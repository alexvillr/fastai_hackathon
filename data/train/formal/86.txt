The interplay of forces (viscous, capillary and gravity) in reservoir models is commonly defined using scaling-group theory (Ringrose et al., 1993; Li and Lake, 1995), with the commonly accepted limiting condition for invasion percolation being that the capillary force must exceed the viscous force by a ratio of ten thousand-to-one.
