In Section 4 we showed that the dominant direction of perturbations of the boundary normal, including those normals for crossings clearly associated with waves, is related to the direction of the local magnetospheric field vector, and we highlighted that this magnetic field influence is consistent with K-H instability theory (e.g. Southwood, 1968).
