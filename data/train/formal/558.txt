In fact, we found a nine-year decrease in SOC stocks over 0-40cm depth by an average, across all shade types, of 9.99MgCha-1 (12.4%) in Costa Rica, whereas in Nicaragua (where the long-term land use before the experiment had been the same as afterwards, shaded coffee) there was a much smaller decrease in average 0-40cm depth SOC stock of 0.2MgCha-1 (0.14%).
