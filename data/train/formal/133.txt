Due to its isolated position (Mutti et al., 1999; Brandano et al., 2012) and long-term stratigraphic record of shallow water sediments (Vecsei and Sanders, 1997) this carbonate platform is well suited to identify local processes possibly overprinting regional or global signals in neritic carbonates.
