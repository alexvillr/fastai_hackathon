Growth of the K-H instability at Earth's magnetopause has been the subject of much research attention, with spacecraft data revealing evidence for K-H vortices associated with plasma mixing and local magnetic reconnection (Fairfield et al., 2000; Nikutowski et al., 2002; Hasegawa et al., 2004, 2006, 2009; Nykyri et al., 2006; Nishino et al., 2011).
