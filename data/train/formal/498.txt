For the interpretation of the energetic electron data we use measurements of the magnetometer MAG onboard the spacecraft (Dougherty et al., 2004) and we correlate the MIMI/LEMMS with plasma electron measurements of the Electron Spectrometer ELS, part of the Cassini Plasma Spectrometer Investigation CAPS (Young et al., 2004).
