The short-lived, positive (upward) vertical velocities seen soon after bore arrival are likely due to the effect of the plunging wave: the resulting clockwise rotation (Miller, 1968; Petti and Longo, 2001) causes the fast fluid close to the free surface to hit the bed and move initially stagnant fluid forward and upward.
