The different amounts of porosity estimated from the tracer technique and in the present dilatometric annealing experiments therefore indicate that only part of the porosity is annealed out up to the maximum annealing temperature of 673K - especially since the percolating porosity detected by the tracer method may be considered as the lower limit of the total porosity.
