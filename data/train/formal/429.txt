Using Lemma 3 with β1=ν+1<ν+3/2=β2 and α1+β1=2ν+2=α2+β2 we see that the first lower bound is uniformly better (larger) than the second one, whereas again with Lemma 3, neither of the upper bounds Gν+1/2,ν+1/2 and Gν,ν+2 is uniformly better (smaller) than the other: in fact, with α1-α2=1/2,β2-β1=3/2 and β2+β1=2ν+5/2, we get t=(9/4-1/4)(4ν2+10ν+25/4-1/4)2⋅(1/2)=2(ν+1)(2ν+3), so that Gν,ν+2(s)<Gν+1/2,ν+1/2(s) for 0<s<t and Gν+1/2,ν+1/2(s)<Gν,ν+2(s) for s>t.
