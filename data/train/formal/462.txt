While the robot placed the flasks gently in the incubator carousel without disturbing the cells, as soon as the carousel was rotated, cell clumps moved under centrifugal force to concentrate in parts of the flask resulting in a heterogeneous distribution of the cell clumps/colonies in the flask; this in particular can result in the growth of differentiated colonies.
