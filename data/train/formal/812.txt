As in Yates et al. (2012), we divided the magnetosphere into four regions: region I, representing open field lines of the polar cap; region II containing the closed field lines of the outer magnetosphere; region III (shaded in figures) is the middle magnetosphere (magnetodisc) where we assume that the Hill-Pontius equation is valid for steady-state conditions.
