Since 2006, the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT) in Niger, in partnership with the national agricultural research program in Mali (Institut d'Economie Rurale, IER), has conducted recurrent selection in a diversified pearl millet genepool to increase frequencies of desirable alleles for Striga and downy mildew resistance and panicle yield using two test sites in West Africa (Sador√© in Niger and Cinzana in Mali).
