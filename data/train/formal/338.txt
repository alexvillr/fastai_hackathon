However, surface soils (0-30cm depth), which store almost half of soil organic carbon (SOC) and up to three times the C stored above-ground in vegetation, are considered to be the most vulnerable to loss as CO2 emissions due to climatic and land-management change, highlighting a major threat to climate regulation (Powlson et al., 2011a).
