In addition, the installation of soil collars several centimetres into the soil, to minimize CO2 leakage in and out of the chamber (Hutchinson and Livingston, 2001), has raised concerns regarding the possibility of measuring Î´13CRs beyond the collar insertion depth (Kayler et al., 2008), and their utility in soil respiration partitioning studies (Heinemeyer et al., 2011).
