Roeber et al. (2010) solved Nwogu's (1993) one-dimensional equations by a hybrid scheme including a shock capturing method based on a Godunov-type procedure; they introduced an eddy viscosity term into the governing equation in order to control the instabilities produced by the sharp gradients of transport quantities.
