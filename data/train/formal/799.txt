Paleobathymetry estimates in the North Sea during the Paleocene and Eocene are difficult to constrain accurately, as the extant benthic foraminifera present in the Paleogene are found today living between 200 and >1000m water depth (Gradstein et al., 1992), and are controlled predominantly by substrate and bottom water properties.
