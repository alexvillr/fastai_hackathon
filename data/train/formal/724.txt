These dropouts (some of which are marked in the second panel of Fig. 4) are more apparent when fluxes are plotted in linear scale (see Supporting Online Material of Jones et al. (2008)), however it is difficult to understand whether they are associated with the interaction region of Rhea or are part of magnetospheric flux variations observed before and after the plotted interval (not shown here).
